    <h1>Asteroids</h1>
    <canvas id="screen" width="760" height="480"></canvas>
    <h2>Instructions <br /><br />
    Pilot your ship with either W,A,S,D or the Arrow keys. Press SPACE to shoot a laser. If your ship is yellow then you are immune. You will not take damage but you cannot shoot.
    You will become mortal again 3 seconds after the beginning of the game or after you lose a life.<br /><br />
    If you collide with an asteroid -- you lose a life. Hit 0 lives and you lose. However, if you shoot an asteroid with your laser it will either split or disappear (depending on the size of the asteroid). <br /><br />
    When asteroids collide they break. However, if the asteroid is a small asteroid then it will be destroyed.<br /><br /> 
    Destroy all of the asteroids on the screen and advance to the next level + gain a life. Score is gained by advancing in level or shooting asteroids. <br /><br />
